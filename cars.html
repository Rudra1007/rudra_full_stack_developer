    <h2>The mafian SUV</h2>
    <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the G-Wagen[1] (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen) is a four-wheel drive automobile manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.

        The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature. <br>
        
        Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 44 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.[2] In 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced the second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to launch a smaller version of the G-Class, named "little G"—though no definitive date was given for the launch.[3] <br>
        
        The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020.[4]
        
        The success of second-generation W463 led to the 500,000th unit milestone three years later in April 2023.[5] The 500,000th model was a special one-off model with agave green paintwork, black front end, and amber turn signal indicators in tribute to the iconic 1979 press release photo of jumping W460 240 GD.[6]</p>
        <h3>The max power & torque of Mercedes-Benz G-Class is 325.86bhp@3600-4200rpm & 700Nm@1200-3200rpm Respectively.

<p>The Land Rover Defender (initially introduced as the Land Rover 110 / One Ten, and in 1984 joined by the Land Rover 90 / Ninety, plus the new, extra-length Land Rover 127 in 1985) is a series of British off-road cars and pickup trucks. They consistently have four-wheel drive, and were developed in the 1980s from the original Land Rover series which was launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show in April 1948. Following the 1989 introduction of the Land Rover Discovery, the term 'Land Rover' became the name of a broader marque, and thus no longer worked as the name of a specific model; thus in 1990 Land Rover renamed the 90 and 110 as Defender 90 and Defender 110 respectively. The 127 became the Defender 130.

    The vehicle, a British equivalent of the Second World War derived (Willys) Jeep, gained a worldwide reputation for ruggedness and versatility. Using a steel ladder chassis and an aluminium alloy bodywork, the Land Rover originally used detuned versions of Rover engines. The original Defender is still being produced in developing countries despite the arrival of the Land Rover Defender (L663).[citation needed] <br>
    <br>
    Though the Defender was not a new generation design, it incorporated significant changes, compared to the series Land Rovers, such as adopting coil springs front and rear, as opposed to all leaf springs on the previous; except for retaining rear leaf springs on high capacity (payload) models. Coil springs offered both better ride quality and improved axle articulation. Adding a lockable centre differential to the transfer case gave the Defender permanent (on-road) four-wheel-drive capability. Both changes were derived from the Range Rover, and the interiors were also modernised.
    
    Externally, a full-length bonnet and full-width integrated grille and headlights, combined with (finally) a single-piece windscreen, plus widened wheel arches that covered new, wider-track axles were the most noticeable changes. Initially the engineering department conserved a part-time 4WD system, like on previous models, but it failed to sell, and this option was dropped in 1984. While the engine was carried over from the Series III, a new series of modern and more powerful engines was progressively introduced. <br>
    <br>
    Even when ignoring the series Land Rovers and perhaps ongoing licence products, the 90/110 and Defender models' 33-year production run were ranked as the sixteenth longest single-generation car in history in 2020.[3]
    
    In 2020, Jaguar Land Rover introduced the first all new generation of Land Rover Defenders, switching from body on chassis to integrated bodywork and from live, rigid axles to all around independent suspension. While starting at a higher base price, the new model brought significant improvements to on road dynamics over the old model, air suspension is available on most trims. The range was originally limited to just two wheelbase lengths before a third, the Defender 130, was announced in 2022. The new Defender series is only available in closed, estate car bodies.</p>
<h3>The 4998 cc Petrol engine generates a power of 517.63bhp@6000-6500rpm and a torque of 625Nm@2500-5500rpm. The 2998 cc Diesel engine generates a power of 296.3bhp@5500rpm and a torque of 400Nm@1500-4000rpm.</h3>

<p>The Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV manufactured by General Motors and marketed by their luxury division Cadillac. It was the luxury brand's first major entry into the SUV market. The Escalade was introduced for the 1999 model year in response to an influx of new luxury SUVs in the late 1990s such as the Mercedes-Benz M-Class, Range Rover, Lexus LX, and (especially) Ford's 1998 debut of the Lincoln Navigator. The Escalade project went into production only ten months after it was approved. The Escalade is built in Arlington, Texas. The term "escalade" refers to a siege warfare tactic of scaling defensive walls or ramparts with the aid of ladders or siege towers. More generally, it is a French word which is the noun-equivalent form of the French verb escalader, which means "to climb or scale". <br>
    <br>
    The Escalade is currently sold in North America and select international markets (Europe and Asia) where Cadillac has official sales channels.[1] The Escalade ESV (Escalade Stretch Vehicle) is sold in North America, Russia, and the Middle East, but is available by special order only in some international markets. The right-hand-drive Escalade and Escalade ESV are available through the third-party conversion specialists without official agreement with Cadillac in Australian, Oceanic, and Japanese markets.
    
    On August 8, 2023, GM unveiled the Escalade IQ, an all-electric version of the Escalade, and the third model in Cadillac's EV line, after the Celestiq, and Lyriq. It is expected to go on sale in late 2024 for the 2025 model year, with a starting price of $130,000.[2][3]
    
    </p>
    <h3>At the heart of the Escalade-V is a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine rated at 682 horsepower (508 kilowatts) and 653 lb-ft of torque (885 Nm).</h3>

    <p>The Aston Martin DBX is a crossover SUV produced by British luxury car marque Aston Martin since 2020.[6] It is the first SUV the company has made.[1][7][8][9] It has been described as both a "full-sized" and as a "mid-sized" vehicle. <br>
    <br>
    The DBX is the first car made at Aston Martin's new facility in St Athan, Wales. According to executive vice president and chief creative officer Marek Reichman, the wheelbase of the DBX stretches as far out as possible for the wheels to be positioned at the corners of the vehicle, which, with the low roofline, creates the illusion of a smaller car, helping make the DBX appear more like a traditional Aston Martin shape. The DBX features swan-hinged doors, while the front grille is the largest ever fitted on an Aston Martin.[10] It has been described by the BBC and the Daily Telegraph as the "first full-size five-seater" model that Aston Martin has sold.[1][11] Sources outside the UK have described it as a "mid-sized crossover".[12][13][14][15]


    Specifications and performance
    While related to the Vantage, the DBX is built on its own dedicated platform. Like other Aston Martin models, it is constructed with bonded aluminium panels and extrusions. The powertrain and infotainment technology are borrowed from Mercedes-Benz. The DBX uses Mercedes-AMG's M177 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine that has a power output of 550 PS (405 kW; 542 hp) and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque.[16] The DBX is capable of accelerating from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 4.5 seconds, and attaining a top speed of 292 km/h (181 mph).[17] A 9-speed automatic gearbox is standard, and towing is rated at up to 2,700 kg (6,000 lb). Its emissions are NEDC Combined CO2 269g/km and its UK combined mpg is 19.73. A 48-volt electric active roll system counteracts body roll under hard cornering, and the vehicle comes with five driving modes: a default GT, Sport, Sport Plus, Terrain and Terrain Plus with an additional Access mode. An active centre transfer case directs torque to the front axle when it is required, and there is also an electronic limited slip rear differential. Adaptive dampers and triple-chamber air springs are both standard, offering a significant range of height adjustment.[18][19]
    
    In November 2021, a new engine appeared. Only available in China, this Mercedes-AMG's M256 3.0-litre turbocharged I6 has a power output of 435 PS (320 kW; 429 hp) and 520 N⋅m (384 lb⋅ft) of torque.[20]</p>
    <h3>The regular DBX is powered by a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine supplied by Mercedes-AMG. The engine makes 542 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque and pairs with a nine-speed automatic transmission, also supplied by Mercedes.</h3>

    <p>The BMW XM is a full-size automobile manufactured in the United States by German marque BMW since 2022.[5][6] It is a crossover SUV with a plug-in hybrid electric drivetrain, and is the second car developed entirely by BMW M, after the BMW M1 in 1978.[8] A more powerful special-edition trim, the "Label Red", was also announced alongside the unveiling of the XM on 27 September 2022.[9][10]

        Overview
        Launch and development
        BMW was Art Basel's official partner for event's 2021 edition, where on 29 November BMW unveiled the concept version of the XM at Miami Beach, Florida.[11] Production of the XM started in December 2022 at the BMW US Manufacturing Company plant in Greer, South Carolina, with deliveries commencing in 2023.[12] BMW also entered a gentlemen's agreement with French carmaker Citroën in order to be able to use the name "XM" for its vehicle, since Citroën originally used it for their XM executive car.[13] <br>
        <br>
        
        Specifications
        Along with its 4.4 L (268.5 cu in) V8, the BMW XM uses an electric motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic gearbox that produces 145 kW (197 PS; 194 hp) and 281 N⋅m (207 lb⋅ft)[14] BMW mentioned that this system is also used in their BMW M Hybrid V8 LMDh car. The electric motor is powered by a 25.7 kWh (92.5 MJ) battery, which has an estimated range of 48 km (30 mi) (US EPA) / 88 km (55 mi) (WLTP), and has regenerative braking recharging abilities.[14] The electric battery, charging at its maximum of 7.4 kW, can charge from 0-100% in 4.25 hours.[15] The towing capacity is 2,700 kg (6,000 lb) for braked trailers, and 750 kg (1,650 lb) for unbraked trailers.[15]
        
        The XM has permanent four-wheel drive, with a bespoke M Sport differential situated at the rear axle allowing for torque vectoring.[14] The XM's handling is controlled by 48-volt electrical active anti-roll bars along with steel springs, adaptive M dampers and active steering.[9] Power is sent via an 8-speed M Steptronic automatic transmission to the 23" wheels which are shod in 275/35R23 tires at the front and 315/30R23 at the rear.[14] The XM uses six-piston fixed-caliper brakes in the front, and single-piston floating-caliper brakes in the rear.[15]</p>
        <h3>A twin-turbocharged V-8 combines with the XM's plug-in hybrid system to produce 644 horsepower in standard models and up to 738 in the XM Label version. Our testing of the standard trim returned a 3.4-second sprint to 60 mph, though the XM proved to be less adept at going slow than fast.</h3>

        <p>The Chevrolet Tahoe, and its badge-engineered GMC Yukon counterpart, are full-size SUVs and other trucks from General Motors, offered since 1994 and 1991, respectively. Since 1982, Chevrolet and GMC sold two different-sized SUVs under their "Blazer" and "Jimmy" nameplates, by introducing the smaller S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy for the 1983 model year, below the full-size Blazer and Jimmy models. This situation lasted into the early 1990s. GMC first rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the "Yukon" in 1991. Chevrolet however waited until 1994, when they rebadged the redesigned mid-size S-10 Blazer the "new Blazer," while renaming the full-size Blazer as the "Tahoe." The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding Lake Tahoe in the western United States, and was originally used as a trim level on S-10 models. The name Yukon refers to the Yukon territory of northern Canada.

For the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new, longer four-door model, slotting in size between the two-door models and the longer-wheelbase Chevrolet/GMC Suburbans.

The Tahoe is sold in North America, parts of Asia such as the Philippines, and the Middle East, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Angola as a left-hand-drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East.

The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon are part of General Motors' full-size SUV family and are differentiated from the similar Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL primarily by the length of the passenger and cargo area behind the C-pillar. An upscale trim GMC Denali sub-model joined the Yukon lineup as the top-of-the-line trim for the 1999 model year; the Cadillac Escalade is a closely related upscale version sharing the same platform. The Denali is available on both standard and XL versions.

The Tahoe has regularly been the best-selling full-size SUV in the United States, frequently outselling its competition by two to one.[1]

<br>
<p>The Toyota Land Cruiser (Japanese: トヨタ・ランドクルーザー, Hepburn: Toyota Rando-Kurūzā) (also sometimes spelled as LandCruiser)[1] is a series of four-wheel drive vehicles produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota. It is Toyota's longest running series of models.[2] As of 2019, the sales of the Land Cruiser totalled more than 10 million units worldwide.[3]

    Production of the first generation of the Land Cruiser began in 1951.[3][4][5] The Land Cruiser has been produced in convertible, hardtop, station wagon and cab chassis body styles. The Land Cruiser's reliability and longevity have led to huge popularity, especially in Australia, where it is the best-selling body-on-frame, four-wheel drive vehicle.[6] Toyota also extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the Australian outback – considered to be one of the toughest operating environments in both temperature and terrain.[7][8][9] In Japan, the Land Cruiser was once exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyota Store.
    
    Since 1990, the smaller variation of the Land Cruiser has been marketed as the Land Cruiser Prado. Described as a 'light-duty' version of the Land Cruiser by Toyota, it features a different design compared to the full-size model and, up until 2023, it remains the only comfort-oriented Land Cruiser available with a short-wheelbase 3-door version.
    
    As of 2023, the full-size Land Cruiser was available in many markets. Exceptions include the United States (since 2021),[10] Canada (since 1996),[11] Malaysia (which receives the Lexus LX instead), Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Brazil, and most of Europe. In Europe, the only countries where the full-size Land Cruiser is officially sold are Gibraltar, Moldova, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. The Land Cruiser is hugely popular in the Middle East, Russia, and Australia, and also in Africa where it is used by farmers, the construction industry, non-governmental and humanitarian organizations, the United Nations, national armies (often the pickup version), and irregular armed groups who turn them into "technicals" by mounting machine guns in the rear. In August 2019, cumulative global sales of the Land Cruiser family surpassed 10 million units.[12]s</p>
    <h3>The Toyota Land Cruiser comes with a 5.7-liter V8 engine that produces 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, providing plenty of power for off-road adventures and towing.</h3>

    <p>The Lamborghini Urus is a luxury SUV manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini. It was introduced in December 2017 as a 2018 model year production vehicle.[4] The Urus is the first Lamborghini SUV and five-door vehicle in the modern era (under the ownership of Volkswagen Group), and the second SUV in the brand's history after the LM002, which was produced between 1986 and 1993.

        Built on the Volkswagen Group MLB Evo platform, the Urus shares many components with other Volkswagen Group luxury SUVs, such as the Audi Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and Volkswagen Touareg. With a top speed of 305 km/h (190 mph), the Urus is considered as one of the fastest production SUVs in the world.
        
        The name comes from the urus, the ancestor of modern domestic cattle, also known as the aurochs.[5]
        
        </p>
<h3>The Urus has a V8 twin-turbocharged engine with a maximum power output of 650 hp, and offers the best power-to-weight ratio in the SUV segment.</h3>

<p>The Toyota Fortuner, also known as the Toyota SW4, is a mid-size SUV manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota since 2004. Built on the Hilux pickup truck platform, it features two/three rows of seats and is available in either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive configuration. It is a part of Toyota's IMV project for emerging markets, which also includes the Hilux and the Innova.

    The name Fortuner is derived from the English word fortune.[1]
    
    Production
    While the first-generation Fortuner was developed in Thailand by Thai and Japanese engineers, its facelifted version, as well as the Hilux and Innova, was designed in Australia by Toyota Australia, which is also responsible for developing the second-generation model.[2]
    
    For the medium body-on-frame SUV segment, Toyota offers the Hilux Surf/4Runner (Japan/North America) and the Land Cruiser Prado (Europe and Australasia). However, in some Central and South American countries and New Zealand, Toyota offers the Fortuner alongside the 4Runner and/or Prado, like in Peru, Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala.
    
    Specialised variants with a naturally-aspirated 5L-E diesel engine is offered to governments, organisations and the UN alongside other utility vehicles such as the Prado, Hilux, HiAce, and the 70 and 200 series Land Cruisers.[3][4]

<p>The Ford Everest is a mid-size SUV produced by Ford Motor Company since 2003. Developed and destined mainly for the Asia-Pacific region with production centered in Thailand, the first-generation Everest is based on the Mazda-based Ford Ranger pickup truck, while the following generations are based on the globally-marketed T6 Ranger. Unlike the Ranger which was paralleled with the Mazda B series or BT-50 until 2020, the Everest has no Mazda equivalent, as it was seen as unfitting for the brand.[1]

    In India, the Everest was marketed as the Ford Endeavour in the Indian market to avoid legal issues due to the existence of a spice-making brand with the same name in the country.[2]

<p>The Ram 1500 TRX is a high-performance variant of the fifth-generation Ram 1500 (DT) pickup truck produced by the Ram Trucks division of Stellantis. The TRX name was based on the Ram Rebel TRX concept that was shown at the 2016 State Fair of Texas as an engineering, design and consumer-interest study.[3] Following consumer feedback, the company announced on June 1, 2018, that it would place the truck into production for the 2021 model year.[4][5] The truck is scheduled to be produced for the 2021 through 2024 model years. The TRX has been dropped after the 2024 model year because it cannot be modified to meet tougher automotive emissions standards.

    The TRX competes with Ford Raptor family of high-performance pickup trucks.[6]

    The non-production modifications of the concept prototype include 37-inch tires mounted on Mopar 18-inch bead-lock wheels featuring body color matched rings, two full size spare wheels and tires in a bed mount configuration also featuring a lockable unit housing a jack, tow strap, and room for more tools. Other production departures include a six inch wider track with extended fenders to cover the wider wheel base, giving the truck an hourglass look when viewed from above, LED clearance lights, a tire rack mounted LED light bar, five inch side exhaust integrated into protective rock rails, skid plates, a 6.2-liter supercharged HEMI V8 engine based on the popular Hellcat featured in Dodge Chargers, Challengers, and the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk, but detuned for the truck application to 575 horsepower mated to a TorqueFlite 8HP70 transmission and a BorgWarner 44-45 transfer case. The drivetrain features four modes from which to choose: Normal, Wet/Snow, Off-road and Baja. The rear axle is a Dynatrac Pro 60 and the vehicle also features an electronic axle locker available in all modes. The modified suspension is built onto a stock "DS" Series Ram platform 1500 frame. The link coil based suspension is upgraded with performance springs, 2.5-inch King Racing Shocks and feature a 40% increase in travel to 13" front and rear from the standard 9".
    
    The interior also features multiple deviations from the stock Ram Rebel 1500 including suede inserts in the seats, "sport-sanctioned lateral support upper bolsters with embroidered logos", six point harnesses, cloth door pulls, a console shifter, a rotary selector for the various drive modes, an anodized steering wheel with accent stitching, paddle shifters, a tool bag featuring TRX labeling, carbon fiber and red metal inlays, a camera mount near the rearview mirror, and a sport bar to which the six point harnesses mount. The concept also features a non-production shade of "Header Red" that was applied in thirty different coats.[7][8]</p>
<h3>The 2021 Ram 1500 TRX is powered by a 6.2-liter supercharged V-8 engine. This is a version of the 707-horsepower Hellcat engine that is found in top models of the Dodge Challenger and Charger. The Ram version puts out 702 horsepower instead of 707 and offers 650 lb-ft of torque @ 4,800 rpm.</h3>

<p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.

    From model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.[2]
    
    The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda / Sapporo,[3] a coupe version of an economical compact car.
    
    The third and current generation is a full-size muscle car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.[4]
    
    In November 2021, Stellantis announced that 2023 model year would be the final model year for both the LD Dodge Charger and LA Dodge Challenger, as the company will focus its future plans on electric vehicles rather than fossil fuel powered vehicles, due to tougher emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency for the 2023 model year.[5] Challenger production ended on December 22, 2023, and the Brampton, Ontario assembly plant will be re-tooled to assemble an electrified successor.[6]

    <h3>Keeping with the theme of more power than you can imagine, the Supercharged 6.2L HEMI® V8 engine comes standard on the Dodge Challenger SRT® Hellcat models. Charged with 717 horsepower and 656 pound-feet of torque, anyone who dares to challenge you won't stand a chance.  </h3>

<p>The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobiles known as pony cars. The Mustang's styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of competition.

    It was introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and convertible with the fastback version to follow in August 1964. Upon introduction, the Mustang, sharing its platform with the Falcon, was slotted into the compact car segment.
    
    With each revision, the first-generation Mustangs grew in overall dimensions and engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic redesign. After an initial surge, sales steadily declined as Ford began working on a new generation Mustang. With the onset of the 1973 oil crisis, Ford was prepared, having already designed the smaller Mustang II for the 1974 model year. This new car shared no components with preceding models.</p>
<h3>Ford rates the output at 290 hp (same as the Z/28) @ 5800 rpm, and no one will dispute that it makes at least that much. Standard with the engine is a wide ratio (2.78 first gear) transmission and a 3.50 axle</h3>

<p>The Chevrolet Camaro is a mid-size[1][2] American automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, classified as a pony car.[3][4][5][6] It first went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year and was designed to compete with the Ford Mustang. The Camaro shared its platform and major components with the Firebird, produced by General Motors' Pontiac division that was also introduced for 1967.

    Four distinct generations of the Camaro were developed before production ended in 2002. The nameplate was revived on a concept car that evolved into the fifth-generation Camaro; production started on March 16, 2009.[7]
    
    The Camaro will be discontinued at the end of the 2024 model year. Production ended in December 2023.[8] However, Chevrolet has stated, "This is not the end of Camaro's story."[9]</p>
<h3>Every 2024 Camaro is rear-wheel drive and offered with two body styles: coupe and softtop convertible. Powertrains include a 335-hp V-6 and a heart-pounding 455-hp V-8. The high-performance 650-hp Camaro ZL1 is reviewed separately.</h3>
